                    <p>Collaborated with a team of two to design and implement the start of an inference engine. The nascent system aims to connect related ideas and content among videos, documents, and images to allow K-12 teachers to upload their lecture content or other learning materials online to a localized repository of information. Students may easily access the information in a meaningful way via complex queries. The application was built with a multitiered architecture with advanced technologies. Personally developed the underlying database, SQL scripts, data analytic chart, and contributed to middleware routes, application logic, and UI panels’ design.</p>

                    <p>Collaborated with a team of three to plan, design, and implement an E-Commerce Customer Relationship Management System (CRM) for supermarket commercial organizations that is designed to provide services and goods, such as mass consumer food products. 
                    
                    <p>The goal of the software was to ease businesses' management of trading partners and data regarding their clients and products.  The program collects, manages, and maintains inhouse inventories as well as clienteles’ contact information, requested orders, correspondences, memos, and transactions.  The CRM package aids in profiling recurring customers, keeping track of item stocks, a history log of previous purchases and services provided with past individuals, and a basic accounts payable system.  The CRM software may be adapted by supermarket commercial organizations that aim to provide services and goods, such as mass consumer food goods. Moreover, primitive data analytics may be incorporated to assist in forecasting frequent clients, high demand orders, etc.</p>
