                    <p>The Heat Strain Decision Aid (HSDA) model is a tool for predicting core body temperature and is used to generate maximal work times and work-rest tables. This project was created during my tenure as an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) research fellow at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) facility. Under the guidance of a computer scientist and research mentor, Dr. Mark Buller, this model builds upon research originally developed in the late 1980s. Since the nascent state of the model in the late half of the 20th century, there have been numerous revisions. This newest version of the tool is translated to JavaScript from Java and MATLAB dependencies.  HSDA is a helpful supplement for military cadre by assessing heat strain for military-relevant tasks involving a combination of risk factors such as high work rates, protective clothing and equipment, and often the requirement to work or train in extremes of climate.</p>

                    <p>The model ingests anthropometrics, environmental conditions, clothing ensemble characteristics, and work activity levels. To develop maximal work times or work-rest tables, the HSDA simulates over a range of environmental conditions and work activity levels for provided acclimation status and clothing ensemble characteristics, taking note of when a pre-selected safety threshold is crossed. The guidance tables and graphs were dynamically generated without external libraries based on the data input provided via plain HTML, CSS, and JS.</p>

                    <p>The <a href='https://usariem.health.mil/index.cfm/research/products' target="_blank">live model web application</a> is available to access for all DoD users at a CAC-enabled site. Also, the accompanying technical report is available upon request.</p>

                    <p>Developed a web application that assesses diet quality among military populations under the guidance of USARIEM Military Nutrition Division (MND) scientists. Improving diet quality is essential in enhancing military service member’s well-being, increasing their resilience and physical performance, and reducing injury rates. In adherence to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA), diet quality has been often measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) score. The researchers at MND seek to improve existing algorithms by developing a twelve-question Healthy Eating Score algorithm (HES-12), a better approach for improving military diet quality.</p>
                    <p>The current means for assessing diet quality HEI scores is time-consuming, taking approximately 20 to 60 minutes to complete, and often requires trained staff to administer. Part of this project’s deliverable is this web application, which is an electronic, self-administrable, field-expedient, and reliable accurate method for providing warfighters feedback on their diet quality.</p>
                    <p>The survey considers the respondent's anthropometrics, exercise routine, weight goals, and eating habits across different food categories. Upon submission, scores are immediately rendered to the participant, and a CSV file is downloaded for the researcher’s use.</p>
